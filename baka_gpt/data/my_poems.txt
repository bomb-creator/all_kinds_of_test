The moonlight drips like honey slow,
On velvet skies, the night aglow.
Stars whisper secrets just to me,
A cosmic dance, a mystery.
The breeze carries tales of old,
Of lovers lost and dreams retold.
In shadows deep, where silence sings,
The heart finds peace, the spirit clings.
In twilight's arms, the world stands still,
A moment caught, a time to fill.
The river flows with silver gleam,
A mirror to the dreams we dream.
The mountains rise, their peaks adorned,
With whispers of the ages worn.
The forest breathes a timeless song,
Where every leaf and branch belong.
The ocean's roar, a lullaby,
A symphony beneath the sky.
The sun dips low, a fiery kiss,

A promise of the night's sweet bliss.
The stars ignite, a jeweled crown,
A tapestry of light unbound.
The night unfolds, a velvet cloak,
Where every shadow softly spoke.
The world in slumber, dreams take flight,
In the quiet hush of endless night.
